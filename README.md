# Video_Reconstruction

In this work, we present three video compressive sensing algorithms. The first algorithm GAP-TV considers the total variance (TV) used for compressive sensing and solve it by the generalized alternating projection (GAP) algorithm. It takes a series of compressed frames and reconstuct them. The second algorithm is the end to end neural network based algorithm that takes a video as input and reconstruct the video.The third algorithm is the state-of-the-art iterative op- timization method DeSCI, which projects the measurement/ residual to the signal space to fit the sampling process in the SCI system and uses WNNM denoising for video patches iteratively. We compare first two algorithms by running three short videos from UCF1011. While the third algorithm, even though promises best results among all, hit a roadblock of lack of resources for computing the reconstruction. Our anal- ysis offers pros and cons of these two algorithms in terms of reconstruction quality and run-time.
